# Air Quality Prediction in Busy Streets (WDL 2022)

**Challenge Provider:** UNStudio

**Leaderboard:** 3rd place out of 50 teams

Project done by the "DataBased" team for Stage 1 of **[World Data League 2022](https://www.worlddataleague.com/)**.

## Context
The Green Mile is a project initiated by UNStudio, Blendingbricks, Heineken, The Rijksmuseum, The Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and The Dutch National Bank.

This challenge aims to transform Stadhouderskade, a busy street in Amsterdam, into a pleasant place for people to stay and enjoy. This street is the most polluted in the city and it is the one with the most traffic and pedestrian accidents.

Through WDL 2022, we can make a case that should create a positive impact on the air quality of this street, as currently the air pollution is a cause for concern.

The goal of this project is associated with United Nation’s **Sustainable Development Goal 11**, "Sustainable Cities and Communities", more specifically with its target 11.6: **"reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality"** (source: [United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11)).
